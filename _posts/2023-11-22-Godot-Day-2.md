Hey hey hey, made another short Godot game using a tutorial so I figure a short post was in order.

This time I followed a tutorial from the official Godot documentation:

[Tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

This tutorial was structured a lot better than the previous one and taught me the proper way to use Godot's scene structures. 

I've also started working on a little game of my own using the what I learned doing this tutorial. I'm trying to hop on the bandwagon and make another suika clone as a test of my development skills, hopefully I can get that coded up and presentable and then I will make a proper tutorial on how to do it.

Keep an eye out, bye!
