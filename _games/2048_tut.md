This is just a fork of the mobile game 2048 that took the world by storm back when I was in highschool. I didn't code this version I'm adding it here as a test of different ways of adding content to this site.

I do plan to dissect the code and make my own version eventually, perhaps with a twist.

I may also make a small tutorial going through the main aspects of the code for my own sanity and learning the ins and outs of how it works in the near future.

But for now
