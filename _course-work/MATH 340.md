# My Impressions:
The course itself was difficult but not the content. The professor lacked an understanding of how linear programming was applicable in everyday life and had extremely strict grading. Grading was more often about memorizing some abstract mathematical proof rather than applying the techniques taught to solve any sort of problems.
