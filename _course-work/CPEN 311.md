# My Impressions:

Overall this was a very difficult course. The projects were very informative for communications protocol. The lectures were chock full of important information but very difficult to follow after a point.
The grading scheme was very heavily based on the homework and project marks. I got 100% because i managed to follow the instructions and complete all the projects in a timely manner.
