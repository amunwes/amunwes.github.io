# My Impressions:

This was the 2nd year design studio course and was one of the few hands on electronics courses we were able to take. Projects consisted of programming microcontrollers, 2 major group projects made up the majority of the grade. The first project was to modify a toaster oven to better control the temperature and use it to do smd soldering.
Due to covid I was deprived of the full experience as classes transitioned to online but it was still a core experience in my ELEC degree.
