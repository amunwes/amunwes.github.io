# My Impressions:

This was the final year capstone design project course spanning 8 months. We as a group of 5 worked on an 8 month project for Line 6 guitars, Yamaha guitar group. The project is larely under NDA but the gist of the work was to design and build an apparatus to allow the engineers at line 6 to measure and model the 2nd motion of guitar strings as they vibrate. The project was wildly successful going above and beyond the expectations laid out by our client.
