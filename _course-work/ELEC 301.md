# My Impressions:

A fundamental electronics course where we primarily learned techniques for designing circuits using BJT's. The Lesson plan and the professor's methods were rather dated and many people didn't adapt well. I took to the material fairly well and after my first poorly graded project report I buckled down and improved my grade out of spite.
