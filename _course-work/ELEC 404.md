# My Impressions:
By far one of the most difficult and challenging courses I have ever taken at UBC. Course content was way out of control, lectures were 3 hours long and impossible to pay attention to for the duration. But the professor was incredibly understanding and saw to it that the entire class was challenged but in no danger of failing. Very much a course where the entire class had to come together and suffer.
