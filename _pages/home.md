excerpt: "This is an in-progress project I've been working on to help build up my portfolio. My name is Andrew and I'm a recent Electrical Engineering Grad. I have a passion and skills geared towards working in software development/data science and I'm hoping that as I build this site it will help me show those skills."

The plan with this site is to help me show off some of my projects and education to potential employers and act as somewhat of a blog for my personal endeavours. 

### Portfolio projects 
is where I plan to create little tutorials for my projects walking the reader through the steps I took and providing code snippets and links to the project on my GitHub.
Future updates:
* Interactive Conway's Game of Life tutorial.
* Plans to recode my DSP classwork from matlab to python.
* Reorganize and recode my ML classwork as a tutorial. 

### Course Work 
will contain information for some of the more important courses i've taken including: grade distributions, my thoughts on the course, and syllabus and homework where possible.

### CV 
just holds a copy of my resume and a more of a timeline of what I've done since highschool.

### Blog posts and publications

### About
Check out the about page for more info on what im using to build this site.

This is my first time building and hosting a website so im hoping to learn alot as I slowly make changes here.
I invite you to come back and visit sometime in the future when I have more impressive things coded up :)
