Well hello there, you appear to have stumbled upon my personal portfolio website. Thats great! too bad its kinda under renovations at the moment....
As you can see in the left panel my name's andrew and im a recent grad of UBC ECE.

The plan with this site is to help me show off some of my projects and education to potential employers and act as somewhat of a blog for my personal endeavours. Currently i'm still working in the planning phase slowly making changes to this template as i decide my next moves but in the future i hope to move some of my more impressive projects into public repos and show them off through this site. 
This is my first time building and hosting a website so im hoping to learn alot as i slowly make changes here.
I invite you to come back and visit sometime in the future when i have more impressive things coded up :) 

Check out the about page for more info on what im using.
