For those interested I'm using the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) jekyll theme, taking some design ideas from the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), hosted using github pages. I highly encourage anyone interested in building a website to check it out. provides free static website hosting and academic templates is a free template thats great for building a basic academic site like this in jekyll.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
