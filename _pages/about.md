Well hello there, you appear to have stumbled upon my personal portfolio website. Thats great! too bad its kinda under renovations at the moment....
As you can see in the left panel my name's andrew and im a recent grad of UBC ECE.

The plan with this site is to help me show off some of my projects and education to potential employers and act as somewhat of a blog for my personal endeavours. Currently i'm still working in the planning phase slowly making changes to this template as i decide my next moves but in the future i hope to move some of my more impressive projects into public repos and figure out a way to host them through this site. 
This is my first time building and hosting a website so im hoping to learn alot as i slowly make changes here.
I invite you to come back and visit sometime in the future when i have more impressive things coded up :).


website things to do:
=====
1. change theme to something better. maybe dark mode.
2. flesh out the course work section, at least get some summaries of each course as well as opinions and grades out.
3. sort out what can be shown and what cant be due to nda or academic integrity....
4. microgames, at the very least i wanna add an interactive conway's game of life to a page
5. should i show off blender work or not???
6. maybe link up my leetcode profile.
