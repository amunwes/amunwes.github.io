Well hello there, you appear to have stumbled upon my personal portfolio website. Thats great! too bad its kinda under renovations at the moment....
As you can see in the left panel my name's andrew and im a recent grad of UBC ECE.

The plan with this site is to help me show off some of my projects and education to potential employers and act as somewhat of a blog for my personal endeavours. Currently i'm still working in the planning phase slowly making changes to this template as i decide my next moves but in the future i hope to move some of my more impressive projects into public repos and figure out a way to host them through this site. 
This is my first time building and hosting a website so im hoping to learn alot as i slowly make changes here.
I invite you to come back and visit sometime in the future when i have more impressive things coded up :)

for those interested im working off the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) hosted using github pages. I highly encourage anyone interested in building a website to check it out. provides free static website hosting and academic templates is a free template thats great for building a basic academic site like this in jekyll.


quick update 08/06/2023: i realized that the academic pages template i've been using is somewhat outdated. It was built off of an early fork of the minimal-mistakes jekyll theme but overwrote alot of the theme defaults so customization was somewhat difficult and I didn't have a way to easily access the alternate themes within minimal mistakes so rather than work through 2 sets of documentation trying to update the jekyll theme im opting to rebuild from scratch using the updated minimal mistakes theme.

In the meantime il leave this work in progress site up while i work on building up the alternate to the same level.


website things to do:
=====
1. <strike> change theme to something better. maybe dark mode. </strike> rebuild from scratch to update jekyll themes.
2. flesh out the course work section, at least get some summaries of each course as well as opinions and grades out.
3. sort out what can be shown and what cant be due to nda or academic integrity....
4. microgames, at the very least i wanna add an interactive conway's game of life to a page
5. should i show off blender work or not???
6. maybe link up my leetcode profile.
