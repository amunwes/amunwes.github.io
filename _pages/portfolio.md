Placeholder for project pages. hopefully some can be embedded into the markdown but i forsee at least a few will require their own github pages to link to.

plans to include:
- interactive conways game of life
- some digital signal and image processing projects recoded in python based on my work in ELEC 421.
- the game 2048 ebedded in the page, (iv seen it done before).
- a webscraper at some point would be cool.
- Some ML projects
  - 404 final project possibly redone a bit
  - some pipelining examples
  - image classifier
  - NN from scratch(?)
  - stock predictor maybe
